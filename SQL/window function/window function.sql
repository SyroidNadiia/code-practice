-- The match is OVER
-- The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.

-- In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.

-- Select the match ID, country name, season, home, and away goals from the match and country tables.
-- Complete the query that calculates the average number of goals scored overall and then includes the aggregate value in each row using a window function.

SELECT 
	-- Select the id, country name, season, home, and away goals
	m.id, 
    c.name AS country, 
    m.season,
	m.home_goal,
	m.away_goal,
    -- Use a window to include the aggregate average in each row
	AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) OVER () AS overall_avg
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN country AS c ON m.country_id = c.id;

-- Select the league name and average total goals scored from league and match.
-- Complete the window function so it calculates the rank of average goals scored across all leagues in the database.
-- Order the rank by the average total of home and away goals scored.

SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank each league according to the average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal)) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;


SELECT 
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
    AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS avg_goals,
    -- Rank leagues in descending order by average goals
    RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) DESC) AS league_rank
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m 
ON l.id = m.country_id
WHERE m.season = '2011/2012'
GROUP BY l.name
-- Order the query by the rank you created
ORDER BY league_rank;

-- PARTITION BY a column
-- The PARTITION BY clause allows you to calculate separate "windows" based on columns you want to divide your results. For example, you can create a single column that calculates an overall average of goals scored for each season.

-- In this exercise, you will be creating a data set of games played by Legia Warszawa (Warsaw League), the top ranked team in Poland, and comparing their individual game performance to the overall average for that season.

-- Where do you see more outliers? Are they Legia Warszawa's home or away games?

-- Complete the two window functions that calculate the home and away goal averages. Partition the window functions by season to calculate separate averages for each season.
-- Filter the query to only include matches played by Legia Warszawa, id = 8673.

SELECT
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
		 ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
    -- Calculate the average goals scored partitioned by season
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_homeavg,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season) AS season_awayavg
FROM match
-- Filter the data set for Legia Warszawa matches only
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673 
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;


-- Construct two window functions partitioning the average of home and away goals by season and month.
-- Filter the dataset by Legia Warszawa's team ID (8673) so that the window calculation only includes matches involving them.

SELECT 
	date,
	season,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
	CASE WHEN hometeam_id = 8673 THEN 'home' 
         ELSE 'away' END AS warsaw_location,
	-- Calculate average goals partitioned by season and month
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
         	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_home,
    AVG(away_goal) OVER(PARTITION BY season, 
            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)) AS season_mo_away
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 8673
    OR awayteam_id = 8673
ORDER BY (home_goal + away_goal) DESC;


-- In this exercise, you will expand on the examples discussed in the video, calculating the running total of goals scored by the FC Utrecht when they were the home team during the 2011/2012 season. Do they score more goals at the end of the season as the home or away team?

-- Complete the window function by:
-- Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.
-- Assessing the running average of home goals scored.
-- Ordering both the running average and running total by date.

SELECT 
	date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_total,
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date 
         ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	hometeam_id = 9908 
	AND season = '2011/2012';

--     Complete the window function by:
-- Assessing the running total of home goals scored by FC Utrecht.
-- Assessing the running average of home goals scored.
-- Ordering both the running average and running total by date, descending.


SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goal, and away goals
	date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal,
    -- Create a running total and running average of home goals
    SUM(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
         ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_total,
    AVG(home_goal) OVER(ORDER BY date DESC
         ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS running_avg
FROM match
WHERE 
	awayteam_id = 9908 
    AND season = '2011/2012';


-- Setting up the home team CTE
-- In this course, we've covered ways in which you can use CASE statements, subqueries, common table expressions, and window functions in your queries to structure a data set that best meets your needs. For this exercise, you will be using all of these concepts to generate a list of matches in which Manchester United was defeated during the 2014/2015 English Premier League season.

-- Your first task is to create the first query that filters for matches where Manchester United played as the home team. This will become a common table expression in a later exercise.

-- Create a CASE statement that identifies each match as a win, lose, or tie for Manchester United.
-- Fill out the logical operators for each WHEN clause in the CASE statement (equals, greater than, less than).
-- Join the tables on home team ID from match, and team_api_id from team.
-- Filter the query to only include games from the 2014/2015 season where Manchester United was the home team.

SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name,
    -- Identify matches as home/away wins or ties
	CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN 'MU Win'
		WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN 'MU Loss'
        ELSE 'Tie' END AS outcome

--     Complete the CASE statement syntax.
-- Fill out the logical operators identifying each match as a win, loss, or tie for Manchester United.
-- Join the table on awayteam_id, and team_api_id.

-- Set up the CTEs so that the home and away teams each have a name, ID, and score associated with them.
-- Select the date, home team name, away team name, home goal, and away goals scored in the main query.
-- Rank the matches and order by the difference in scores in descending order.

-- Set up the home team CTE
